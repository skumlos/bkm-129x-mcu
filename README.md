BKM-129X-MCU

An attempt to replicate the workings of the microcontroller on
the Sony BKM-129X RGB/Component option card.

Copy if you wanna, but cool kids give credit where due...

I did not write digitalWriteFast.h it was found here:
https://github.com/NicksonYap/digitalWriteFast
I could find no apparent license so if the authors does
not wish me to include it, please email me...

Version 1.0 confirmed working on:
PVM-9L2
PVM-14L4
PVM-20L5
BVM-D14H5U
BVM-D9H5U

"Working" as in, the monitors detect the card as a BKM-129X.
The different monitors are more or less picky regarding the 
signals but that is up to the board that implements this part
of the complete BKM-129X board. For examples of this, see
https://github.com/skumlos/bkm-129x-simple

Special credit goes out to Nick Carney and Bob from RetroRGB
for rigorious testing and being patient with my software :)
